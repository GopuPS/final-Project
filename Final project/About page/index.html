            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p>In 1946, Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo K.K. launched Sony. (Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation, The predecessor of Sony Group Corporation).</p>
            <p>The company's initial capital was barely 190,000 yen, and it only had 20 workers. Masaru Ibuka was the company's original creator, and his mission </p>
            <p>statement read: "Establish an ideal factory that stresses a spirit of freedom and open mindedness that will, through technology, contribute to Japanese</p>
            <p>culture." Sony has continuing to put out a tonne of innovative products By adhering to the company's core goal to "do what has never been done before," it has</p>
            <p>produced "Japan's first" and "world's first" items.</p>

            <p>The Tokyo Telecommunications Research Institute, later known as Sony, released the rice cooker as its first product.</p>
            <p> For Ibuka, a co-founder of Sony, and his team, it was a remarkable first failure. It was uncommon to get delicious rice</p>
            <p>since the rice cooker often produced undercooked or overdone rice. World War II had barely finished at the time of this.</p>

                <p>Sony, the company's official name from January 1958, is derived from the Latin word sonus, which means "sound," and was intended to be a worldwide brand. </p>

                <p>  was the original Sony Walkman model, and it was a major commercial success when it was introduced in 1979. </p>
